# Addiction Logger

Helps quantify your addiction. Everytime you smoke, eat junk, watch porn, open twitter, or do any of the other crap that controls you, you have to press a key on the mobile app, or your computer app (or on the website). No writing, recording or journaling; just tap/click on a button that's displayed on the screen. If you are faithful to this, you will see a pattern at the end of each week, that's up to you to interpret/analyse. You will neither see a notification, nor will you get a promotional email to remind you about this. You have to remember to log.

This is not an app that cares about you, but shows your quantified addiction patterns. That's it.
